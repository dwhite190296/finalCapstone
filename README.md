# About:
# 1- This Python program determines the amount someone will make on an investment or owe on a bond. It presents a menu for the user to choose between investment or bond, and based on their selection, prompts for specific inputs such as deposit amount, interest rate, and repayment term for bonds. The program then calculates and outputs the corresponding results, considering simple or compound interest for investments and the monthly repayment amount for bonds. It includes error handling for invalid menu selections and utilises the math module for mathematical calculations.
